Do yourself a favor and just shell out the $10 or so for this version with extra header pins and a reset button.
You can acquire the ESP module and flasher separately ($3.5 for the ESP, $2 for the flasher without header pins) a little cheaper,
but remember that you have to pull a pin low to flash, and you'll need to access a GPIO pin for your sensor.
This gives you the best of both worlds since a F-F header can jump the pins you need for flashing and then connect to your sensor module.
